    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone, I'm Freya Xu, currently in my second semester of a Master of Computer Science program. I transitioned from social sciences to coding due to my strong interest in technology. In my first semester, I achieved an average grade of 80, but I don't have much hands-on experience yet. I'm looking forward to improving through real-world projects!</p>
